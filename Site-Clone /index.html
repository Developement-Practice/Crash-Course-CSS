            India has also come up with specialised programmes in robotics field in IITs and other universities. Also,
            it

            has moved beyond the traditional areas and entered newer domains of education, rehabilitation, entertainment
            etc. Robotics has helped handicapped people by replacing their (damaged) limbs with artificial parts that
            can
            duplicate the natural movements.

            Like a coin has two sides, robotics too has a flip side to it. The biggest barrier in the development of
            robots
            has been the high costs of its hardware such as sensors, motors etc. The customisation and updation is also
            an
            added problem.

            With new advancements taking place each passing day, new product introduction is a problem for the existing
            users. Robots cut down labour, thereby reducing the opportunities of employment for many. In many developed
            countries, scientists are making robotic military force that can prove dangerous to others. As the power and
            capacity of computers continues to expand, revolution is being created in the field of robotics. Imagination
            is
            coupled with technology. It would not be wrong to say that in near future there will be a time when robots
            will
            become smarter than the human race.
